#FlexiFeature

 It is an application to manage the Application's feature.
 In the scaled agile environment Features and Capabilities is important aspect to consider.
 
 ```
Features and Capabilities ( details in from Scaled Agile, Inc.)
 A Feature is a service that fulfills a stakeholder need. Each feature includes a benefit hypothesis and acceptance criteria, and is sized or split as necessary to be delivered by a single Agile Release Train (ART) in a Program Increment (PI).
 
 A Capability is a higher-level solution behavior that typically spans multiple ARTs. Capabilities are sized and split into multiple features to facilitate their implementation in a single PI. Features also lend themselves to the Lean UX process model, which includes a definition of the Minimum Marketable Feature (MMF), a benefit hypothesis, and acceptance criteria.
 
 The MMF helps limit the scope and investment, enhances agility, and provides fast feedback.  Capabilities behave the same way as features. However, they are at a higher level of abstraction and support the definition and development of large Solutions.
